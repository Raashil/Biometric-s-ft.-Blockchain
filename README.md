# Biometric-s-ft.-Blockchain
Final Year Project
Block-chain is a distributed immutable ledger technology. It is consisting of blocks, and each block contains multiple transactions. Block-chain consists of a secure hash, timestamp, data of the current block, and the hash value of the previous block. Block- chain records all transactions across the network so that it cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.
Biometric identification system usage has increased as it provides an auspicious way to identify users. While compared with traditional authentication methods Biometric is more reliable and convenient. Block-chain was designed initially to solve double spending problems in peer-to-peer payment system of Bitcoin.
But, since then its applications gone through the original intended use because of its properties, i.e., decentralization, immutability, no trusted authority, and auditability. In this project it proposes how this Block-chain technology can have applied in biometric identification scheme like Aadhar in cloud server-to make Aadhar more transparent.
